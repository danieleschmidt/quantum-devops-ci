   # Create lockfiles for reproducible builds
   npm install  # Generates package-lock.json
   pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt
   ```

4. **🏷️ Repository Topics & Settings** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Add GitHub topics: `quantum-computing`, `devops`, `ci-cd`, `qiskit`, `cirq`
   - Enable GitHub Pages for documentation
   - Configure branch protection rules
