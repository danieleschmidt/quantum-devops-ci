# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The `quantum-devops-ci` project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security-related configurations.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via:

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories
1. Go to https://github.com/quantum-devops/quantum-devops-ci/security/advisories
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form

### Alternative Method: Email
Send detailed vulnerability reports to: **security@quantum-devops.org**

### What to Include
Please include as much information as possible:
- **Vulnerability Type**: What kind of security issue (injection, auth bypass, etc.)
- **Location**: Which file(s), line numbers, or component
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected systems
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We commit to the following response times:
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage Assessment**: Within 7 days  
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Security Fix**: Critical issues within 30 days

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit security linting on all Python code
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety checks for known vulnerabilities
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks prevent credential leaks
- **Supply Chain**: Dependency pinning and integrity verification

### Quantum-Specific Security
- **Credential Management**: Secure handling of quantum hardware tokens
- **Circuit Validation**: Input sanitization for quantum circuits
- **Resource Limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion attacks
- **Hardware Access**: Secure quantum hardware authentication

### Infrastructure Security
- **CI/CD Security**: Secure GitHub Actions workflows
- **Container Security**: Minimal base images and vulnerability scanning
- **Access Control**: Least-privilege access patterns
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging

## üîë Secure Configuration

### Environment Variables
Never commit these sensitive values:
```bash
# Quantum hardware credentials
QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN=your_token_here
AWS_BRAKET_CREDENTIALS=your_credentials_here
GOOGLE_QUANTUM_AI_KEY=your_key_here

# CI/CD secrets
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
NPM_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### Quantum Credentials Storage
Recommended secure storage methods:
- **GitHub Secrets**: For CI/CD workflows
- **Environment Variables**: For local development
- **Credential Files**: In `~/.qiskit/`, `~/.aws/`, etc. (gitignored)
- **Key Management**: AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.

## üö´ Security Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Practices:
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T: Hardcode credentials
QISKIT_TOKEN = "abc123xyz789"

# ‚ùå DON'T: Log sensitive data
print(f"Using token: {token}")

# ‚ùå DON'T: Include credentials in URLs
url = f"https://api.quantum.ibm.com/?token={token}"

# ‚ùå DON'T: Store secrets in version control
config = {"ibm_token": "secret_token_here"}
```

### ‚úÖ Secure Patterns:
```python
# ‚úÖ DO: Use environment variables
import os
token = os.getenv('QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN')

# ‚úÖ DO: Validate input circuits
from quantum_devops_ci.security import validate_circuit
validated_circuit = validate_circuit(user_circuit)

# ‚úÖ DO: Use secure credential storage
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
service = QiskitRuntimeService()  # Uses secure credential file

# ‚úÖ DO: Implement resource limits
@circuit_resource_limit(max_qubits=20, max_depth=100)
def process_circuit(circuit):
    return optimize_circuit(circuit)
```

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests
```bash
# Run security scans
npm run security:scan

# Check for vulnerabilities
pip-audit

# Validate quantum configurations
quantum-test security --check-credentials --validate-circuits
```

### Manual Security Review
- **Code Review**: All PRs require security-focused review
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external security assessments
- **Quantum Circuit Analysis**: Validation of circuit input handling
- **Access Control Audit**: Review of hardware access permissions
