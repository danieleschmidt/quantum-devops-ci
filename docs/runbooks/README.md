```markdown
# Title

## Severity: [Critical|High|Medium|Low]

## Overview
Brief description of the scenario

## Detection
How to identify this situation

## Impact
What happens if not addressed

## Response Steps
1. Immediate actions
2. Investigation steps
3. Resolution procedures
4. Verification steps

## Severity Levels

### Critical (P0)
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- **Examples**: Service outage, security breach, quantum hardware failure
- **Escalation**: Immediate to on-call engineer and management

### High (P1)
- **Response Time**: < 1 hour during business hours
- **Examples**: Performance degradation, cost alerts, partial service disruption
- **Escalation**: On-call engineer, notify team lead

### Medium (P2)
- **Response Time**: < 4 hours during business hours
- **Examples**: Non-critical feature issues, monitoring alerts, resource warnings
- **Escalation**: Assigned to appropriate team member

### Low (P3)
- **Response Time**: Next business day
- **Examples**: Documentation updates, minor optimizations, informational alerts
- **Escalation**: Regular team workflow

## On-Call Procedures

### Primary Response
1. Acknowledge alert within 5 minutes
2. Assess severity and impact
3. Follow appropriate runbook
4. Update incident tracking system
5. Communicate status to stakeholders
