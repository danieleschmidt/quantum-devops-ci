# ADR-0001: Quantum Framework Abstraction Layer

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Development Team, Architecture Review Board
* Date: 2025-08-02
* Technical Story: Enable multi-framework support for quantum CI/CD

## Context and Problem Statement

The quantum computing ecosystem includes multiple frameworks (Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane) with different APIs, circuit representations, and hardware integrations. How do we provide a unified CI/CD experience across these frameworks while maintaining framework-specific optimizations?

## Decision Drivers

* Framework diversity in quantum computing ecosystem
* Need for unified CI/CD workflows
* Performance optimization requirements
* Hardware provider integrations
* Future framework extensibility
* Developer experience consistency

## Considered Options

1. Single framework focus (Qiskit only)
2. Direct multi-framework support with conditional logic
3. Abstraction layer with framework adapters
4. Plugin architecture with framework plugins

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Plugin architecture with framework plugins", because it provides the best balance of extensibility, maintainability, and performance while allowing framework-specific optimizations.

### Positive Consequences

* Easy addition of new quantum frameworks
* Framework-specific optimizations preserved
* Clean separation of concerns
* Consistent developer experience
* Future-proof architecture

### Negative Consequences

* Additional complexity in plugin management
* Performance overhead for abstraction layer
* Increased testing surface area

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Single framework focus (Qiskit only)

* Good, because simple implementation
* Good, because no abstraction overhead
* Bad, because limits ecosystem adoption
* Bad, because vendor lock-in

### Direct multi-framework support with conditional logic

* Good, because straightforward implementation
* Good, because no plugin complexity
* Bad, because difficult to maintain
* Bad, because framework coupling

### Abstraction layer with framework adapters

* Good, because unified API
* Good, because framework isolation
* Bad, because performance overhead
* Bad, because limited framework-specific features

### Plugin architecture with framework plugins

* Good, because extensible and maintainable
* Good, because framework-specific optimizations
* Good, because clean architecture
* Bad, because initial complexity
* Bad, because plugin management overhead
