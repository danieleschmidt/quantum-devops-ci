# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
quantum computing community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  quantum computing community
* Sharing knowledge about quantum algorithms, hardware, and best practices
* Encouraging newcomers to quantum computing and helping them learn
* Providing constructive feedback on quantum circuit designs and implementations
* Respecting the complexity and learning curve of quantum computing concepts

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
* GitHub repositories and discussions
* Quantum computing conferences and workshops
* Online forums and chat channels
* Social media interactions related to the project
* Collaboration with quantum hardware providers and research institutions

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Quantum Computing Specific Guidelines

As a community focused on quantum computing and DevOps, we also commit to:

### Technical Discussions
* **Be patient with learning curves**: Quantum computing is complex and requires significant background knowledge
* **Explain quantum concepts clearly**: When discussing quantum algorithms, circuits, or hardware, provide context for different experience levels
* **Cite sources**: When referencing quantum research, papers, or implementations, provide proper attribution
* **Acknowledge limitations**: Be honest about the current state of quantum technology and its limitations

### Hardware and Resource Sharing
* **Respect shared resources**: When using quantum hardware or simulators, be mindful of costs and queue times
* **Share access fairly**: Don't monopolize expensive quantum hardware resources
* **Document usage**: Keep clear records of quantum experiments and resource consumption for cost transparency

### Code and Implementation Standards
* **Test on simulators first**: Before using expensive quantum hardware, validate circuits on simulators
* **Optimize for hardware constraints**: Consider gate counts, connectivity, and noise characteristics
* **Share benchmarking data**: When possible, share performance and cost data to help the community
* **Respect intellectual property**: Be mindful of proprietary quantum algorithms and hardware specifications

### Collaboration with Industry
* **Maintain confidentiality**: Respect NDAs and confidential information from quantum hardware providers
* **Follow access policies**: Adhere to usage policies for quantum cloud services and research programs
* **Credit collaborators**: Acknowledge contributions from industry partners and research institutions
